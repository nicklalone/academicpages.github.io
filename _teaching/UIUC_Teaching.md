I began as an adjunct at the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in the Fall of 2017. Currently, I have been responsible for 2 courses in the Masters of Science in Information Management program. Those two courses, Foundations of Information Processing and Socio-Technical Information Systems are as inverse of courses as possible. It has been tremendously exciting to teach these courses in person and online.

### Foundations of Information Processing

> **Catalog Description** Covers common data, document processing, and programming constructs and concepts. Focuses on problem solving and abstraction with a programming language. By the end of the course students will be able to design, develop and test a moderately complex computer program to manage full text, bibliographic records or multimedia. The course prepares students for working with applications in data analytics, data science, digital libraries, text mining and knowledge management. No prior programming background is assumed.

### Socio-Technical Information Systems

> **Catalog Description** The character, success, and costs/benefits of information technologies are socio-technical matters. Because of this, best practice for IT design and integration relies on participants' ability to understand and create for the totality of those settings, including social and technical dimensions. This course provides students with analytic tools for examining socio-technical settings and experience in applying that knowledge in IT modeling, design and management.
