At Bellevue University, I have been involved with Data Science, Game Design, Graphic Design, and Business Analytics. As current director of the Data Science program, I have sought to create a program that fosters human-centric, critical and curious thinkers who are capable of telling unique, easy to understand stories. This program is domain agnostic but students are free to use data from their respective fields as needed.

This game studies program was created to reflect the usual course path of a Fine Arts program. Much of the course load reflected studio exploration and personal development over in-depth, socratic-style instruction. As an instructor, I inherited this program when it was sunset and had to teach out its existing enrollment. Recently, I have begun to re-calibrate much of this program by starting with a game programming course using the fantasy console PICO-8.

### Introduction to Game Design

**Catalog Description:** Introduction to Game Design explores the practice and form of Games Design. Topics include introduction to interaction design, history of game theory, introduction to methodologies of rule-based systems, collaborative production work-flows, meaningful play and introduction to interactive narrative design.

### Introduction to Game Development

> **Catalog Description:** This course further explores the development and practice of Game Design and how it applies to interactive art. Topics include introduction to interactive narrative design, the basics of video game programming and computer-mediated interactive systems, collision management, version control, interface design and exporting.

### Introduction to 2D Design

**Catalog Description:** Digital 2D Design provides beginning through intermediate concepts and practice in digital 2D design. Topics covered include fundamentals of digital color theory, digital imaging, selection tools, layering, digital painting tools, and photo retouching. Students will incorporate basic design principles in their texture designs and compositions.

### Interactive Narrative Design

**Catalog Description:** This course examines the role of narrative in interaction design. Course topics include electronic narrative, including principles and techniques of segmentation, navigation, juxtaposition, encyclopedic storylines, and multiple points of view, approaches to non-linear narrative design.

### Animation

**Catalog Description:** This course investigates the fundamental principles of digital animation. This course will survey the historical development of the animated film and develop basic skills in pre-production, digital modeling, simulated movement, perception and the basics of digital animation. Additional topics covered include the relationships among; anatomy, motion, weight, and timing through a combination of individual and group projects.

### Interactive Sound Design

**Catalog Description:** GAME 311 provides an in-depth study of sound effect design and development within interactive contexts. Topics covered include the history of sound in games, the development of MIDI, audio production process, and approaches to nonlinear sound design in games through a combination of individual and group projects.

### Introduction to 3D Design

**Catalog Description:** This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of 3-dimensional design for digital contexts. Topics covered include fundamentals of volume, space, proportion, weight, mass, digital modeling tools, extrusion, meshes, polygon modeling and curves.

### Beginning Portfolio Development

**Catalog Description:** This course covers designing an industry quality portfolio and cultivating and maintaining an industry network. The portfolio started in this course will be built upon in subsequent courses and will be used in internship applications.

### Intermediate Digital Design

**Catalog Description:** This course further examines the principles of 2D and 3D visual design for games. It places an emphasis on using digital tools to produce concept art and pre- and post-production materials for portfolios and personal projects. Students will explore the processes of asset, interface and environment design.

### Intermediate Portfolio Development

**Catalog Description:** This course covers refining the professional-grade portfolio started in Beginning Portfolio Deelopment. Topics covered include occupational social-networking, industry-profiles, visibility and presentation.

### User-Experience and User-Interface Design

**Catalog Description:** This course provides an in-depth study of game interactivity, including the psychology of user interaction and methods for designing and developing effective interfaces. Combining their previous knowledge of game design and digital imaging with the concepts in this class, students will create portfolio-quality interface designs.

### Serious Games and Critical Play

**Catalog Description:** This course in Serious Games and Critical Play examines games and play as used for political, aesthetic and social purposes. Topics covered include the history and contemporary practice of games as performative objects, subversive play, and games for change.

### Introduction to Game Programming

**Catalog Description:** This course explores structured programming in game development. Course topics include languages, programming techniques, algorithms, game testing, game logic, real-time 3D rendering, asset control, and pipeline management. Students will program and complete several games.

### Level Design

**Catalog Description:** This course explores the layout and content design of analog and digital interactive spaces. Students will complete a combination of exercises, individual and collaborative projects that address the creation of interactive spaces as emotional feedback systems, reward systems, narrative systems and others. 

### Advanced Digital Design

**Catalog Description:** This course is an advanced examination of the mastery of 2D and 3D visual design for games. It places an emphasis on using digital tools to produce visual asset art and pre- and post-production materials for portfolios and personal projects. Topics covered include the demonstration of mastery in asset, interface and environment design.

I worked as an adjunct for this program. Each course was created around a slow path through graphic design concepts leading up to user-experience and re-design of a charity or concept of their choice. This program was an eye-opener as it was some of the first content I was asked to teach that introduced students the basics of HTML, CSS, JQuery, and the skills needed to manipulate files on servers meant to access for webpages.

One of the most fantastic moments at Bellevue University came through this program. I was asked to take over this program's direction after the Game Studies program was complete. This program was created by someone who left the university quickly after it was finished being developed. As a new program director, I am looking forward to re-doing this program once Data Science is complete.
