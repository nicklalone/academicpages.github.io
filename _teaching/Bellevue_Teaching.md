At Bellevue University, I have been involved with Data Science, Game Design, Graphic Design, and Business Analytics. As current director of the Data Science program, I have sought to create a program that fosters human-centric, critical and curious thinkers who are capable of telling unique, easy to understand stories. This program is domain agnostic but students are free to use data from their respective fields as needed.

This game studies program was created to reflect the usual course path of a Fine Arts program. Much of the course load reflected studio exploration and personal development over in-depth, socratic-style instruction. As an instructor, I inherited this program when it was sunset and had to teach out its existing enrollment. Recently, I have begun to re-calibrate much of this program by starting with a game programming course using the fantasy console PICO-8.

I worked as an adjunct for this program. Each course was created around a slow path through graphic design concepts leading up to user-experience and re-design of a charity or concept of their choice. This program was an eye-opener as it was some of the first content that was meant to teach students the basics of HTML, CSS, JQuery, and the skills needed to manipulate files on servers meant to access for webpages.

One of the most fantastic moments at Bellevue University came through this program. I was asked to take over this program's direction after the Game Studies program was complete. This program was created by someone who left the university quickly after it was finished being developed. As a new program director, I am looking forward to re-doing this program once Data Science is complete.
