My time as a graduate student at the Pennsylvania State University was also spent teaching and learning about various aspects of project development. My first semester was an interesting experience as I led a team of undergraduate learning assistants and served as a managed of 27 teams in a 170 student course. Later, I was awarded a teaching position as a graduate student and taught students from all over the university about HTML and CSS. This work would introduce me to teaching large courses in-person, a skillset I was lacking from my time teaching online courses at Bellevue.
