title: "The Data Science Program and Skill Network Map"
excerpt: "Data Science is new and weird and doesn't always make sense. Much of the information that is out there is contradictory as well as dense and difficult to parse. For the advising team at Bellevue University, I started to collect a number of skills, concepts, and programs that students would learn in the program I created. I then mapped each of these to their respective courses and stuck it inside of NodeXL and then a Gephi compatible file. The result should be useful enough for students and advisors. <br/><br/> <img src='/images/gexfjs.png'>"

When I began to create the data science program at Bellevue University, I wanted to create a program that relied on a network map of skills that could be traced to courses. 

The result was creating a graph file of a list of skills learned per course and mapping them to each course and throughout the program.
