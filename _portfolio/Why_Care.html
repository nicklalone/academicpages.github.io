title: "Why Should I Care?"
excerpt: "It is difficult to reach students at times. They are busy and the frustration of learning that much of their consumer behavior is not from choice but marketing is difficult to accept, let alone teach. I have constantly tried to find new and exciting ways to think about how to approach students in this way. This attempt was somewhat successful but difficult to attend to due to my own schedule. I wanted to try to make some super brief videos that captured a level of criticism that would speak to students in design programs. The result was the creation of 5 minute briefs about why designers should care about things they might not notice normally. <br/><br/> <img src='/images/firewatch.jpg'>"
