excerpt: 'A primary component of disaster response is training. These educational exercises provide responders with the
knowledge and skills needed to be prepared when disasters happen. However, traditional training methods, such
as high-fidelity simulations (e.g., real-life drills) and classroom courses, may fall short of providing effective
and cost-efficient training that is needed for today’s challenges.'

A primary component of disaster response is training. These educational exercises provide responders with the
knowledge and skills needed to be prepared when disasters happen. However, traditional training methods, such
as high-fidelity simulations (e.g., real-life drills) and classroom courses, may fall short of providing effective
and cost-efficient training that is needed for today’s challenges. Advances in technology open a wide range of
opportunities for training using computer-mediated simulations and exercises. These exercises include the use of
mixed reality games and wearable computers. Existing studies report on the usefulness of these technologies for
training purposes. This review paper synthesizes prior research and development of disaster response simulations
and identifies challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned. Through this review, we provide researchers and
designers with an overview of current practices in designing training simulations and contribute practical insights
into the design of future disaster response training.
