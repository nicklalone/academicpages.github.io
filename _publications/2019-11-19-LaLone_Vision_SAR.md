Search and rescue (SAR) operations are often nearly computer-technology-free due to the fragility and connectivity needs of current information communication technology (ICT). In this design fiction, we envision a world where SAR uses augmented reality (AR) and the surplus labor of volunteers during crisis response efforts.

Unmanned aerial vehicles, crowdsourced mapping platforms, and concepts from video game mapping technologies can all be mixed to keep SAR operations complexity-free while incorporating ICTs. Our scenario describes a near-future SAR operation with currently available technology being assembled and deployed without issue. After our scenario, we discuss socio-technical barriers for technology use like technical fragility and overwhelming complexity. We also discuss how to work around those barriers and how to use video games as a testbed for SAR technology. We hope to inspire more resilient ICT design that is accessible without training.
