Welcome to my digital home! My name is Nick LaLone and I am a researcher of the socio-technical who focuses on how humans and non-humans get to know each other. I began my life in academia not as a grad student but as administrative staff. I worked with Sociologists as someone who was meant to "foster technology use." I found this work fascinating and it introduced me to a number of concepts, epistemologies, and philosophies surrounding non-human actors. I enolled at Pennsylvania State University intending to gain new perspectives as an information scientist and have slowly expanded my scope to learning how people, places, and things all learn to work together. 

This space has housed many different iterations as I have moved from Sociology to Game Design to Crisis Informatics to Data Science but each time, it serves as a space for me to organize my thoughts, my work, and to curate a collection that represents who I am.
