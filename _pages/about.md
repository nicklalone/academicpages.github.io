Welcome to my digital home! My name is Nick LaLone and I am a researcher of the socio-technical. This space has housed many different iterations as I have moved from Sociology to Game Design to Crisis Informatics to Data Science but each time, it serves as a space for me to organize my thoughts, my work, and to curate a collection that represents who I am.
