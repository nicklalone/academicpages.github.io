Welcome to my digital home! My name is Nick LaLone and I am a researcher of the socio-technical who focuses on how humans and non-humans get to know each other. I began my life in academia not as a grad student but as administrative staff. I worked with Sociologists as someone who was meant to "foster technology use." I found this work fascinating and it introduced me to a number of concepts, epistemologies, and philosophies surrounding non-human actors. I enolled at Pennsylvania State University intending to gain new perspectives as an information scientist and have slowly expanded my scope to learning how people, places, and things all learn to work together. 

That black box called the computer is quickly becoming invisible and has begun to replicate the very fabric of culture, of society itself. My perspectives as a Sociologist have often been a hindrence as I have had to learn how to allow objects, non-human, designed, and tangible objects influence human activity in ways that force us to reconsider our place within the vastness of our history, our creations, and our relationship amongst those things.
